# datafun-04-jupyter
Project 4 uses a combination of Python and Markdown to create an initial data story in a Jupyter Notebook. The project includes a project virtual environment with popular libraries for data analytics including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and introduces a common process for starting exploratory data analysis projects.

# Create and Activate Project Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r "requirements.txt"

git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```
